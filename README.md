# Building a Data-Driven App with AngularJS

Want to create web applications that can handle multiple users, registration, and real-time data? With these AngularJS tutorials, you'll be quickly building apps with advanced features like these. Ray Villalobos starts the course with a Git, Node.js, and GitHub setup that will get you off on the right foot. Next, learn how to create your first controller, connect a Firebase database, and read, push, and delete data from that database. Ray then shows you how to set up user registration with Firebase's simpleLogin service, so you can log users in and out and pass registration data back and forth from the app. With a few finishing touches, like custom directives, your Angular app will be ready to publish.
